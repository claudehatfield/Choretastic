# Choretastic

## Intent of Application 

The intent of the application is to provide parents and children and easy way to manage household chores, while teaching children about finances. The parents will have a way to add chores to a calander and set a value to each chore(some sort of reward). The child will see the list and be able to check off when chore is completed and then have a updated record of his "reward payout". The child will also be able to "suggest" an accomplishment that they are proud of, and the parent can reward that accomplishment.

I think this is a valuable tool to help children learn that hard work pays off in the end.
